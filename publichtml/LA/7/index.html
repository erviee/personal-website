            The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S., US or the States), or simply America, is a sovereign country mostly in North America. It is divided into 50 states. Forty-eight of these states and the District of Columbia border each other between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

                The land that would one day become the United States was first settled by migrating tribes from Siberia that walked across a land bridge about 20,000 years ago. These people were the ancestors of the Native Americans. European colonization began in the 16th century with several European nations setting up colonies in North America.
