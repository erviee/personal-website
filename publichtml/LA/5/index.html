    <h2 class="maligno">Light Reaction Regiment (Maligno sa tulay)</h2>
    <p>One of the most exclusive combat patch in the AFP worn only by members of the 16-man LRR Sniper Task Group, made up of LRR snipers from 5LRC, Higher Headquarters Company (HHC) and Light Reaction School (LRS), who wreaked havoc on the ranks of the IS-affiliated DWIM in Marawi 24/7 from June to October 2017.
    </p>
    <p>Their validated record: a 87 confirmed kills (including "AM", "Doc" and other HVTs) + dozens "probables", 70% of which were done at night time. (Note: The IH and OM takedowns were executed by a separate LRR sniper team from 4LRC)</p>
    <p>Longest recorded sniper night time kills in the AFP (Proof: Recorded by US MARSOC on video using their equipment)
    <pre>
        1 confirmed kill @ 1.11km
        
        1 confirmed kill @ 1.13km
        
        3 confirmed kills @ 1.165km
        
        2 "probable" kills @ 1.165km
    </pre></p>
    <p>What makes their accomplishment jaw-dropping was the fact that they were never detected by the enemy during their 5-month stint in Marawi. The only indications of their presence at night were strange sounds streaking across the sky at blinding speed.</p>
    <p>Note:<q>Probables</q> was the term STG used in their spot reports of confirmed hits but were not counted as confirmed kills due to the absence of actual dead bodies of insurgents recovered. During the conflict, STG reported numerous probables, all confirmed body hits from M118LR. These fatally wounded targets disappeared but the large wound channels created by Boat Tail Hollow Point (BTHP) rounds and the lack of medical facility in the main battle area made the probables/confirmed hits, high probable kills.</p>
