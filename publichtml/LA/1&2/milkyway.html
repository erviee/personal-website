        <p><strong>The Milky Way</strong> is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, 
        with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars 
        that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, 
        from the Greek γαλακτικὸς κύκλος (galaktikòs kýklos), meaning "milky circle".
        From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within.</p>
