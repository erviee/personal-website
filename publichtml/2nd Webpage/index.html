    <p><b>Nikola Tesla</b>, <i>(born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January 7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.</i>), Serbian American inventor and engineer who 
        discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. 
        He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, 
        transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the <mark>Tesla coil</mark>, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

        Tesla was from a family of <ins>Serbian origin</ins>. His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent.
         As he matured, he displayed remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic touch.</p>

        <p>Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, Austria, and the University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an electric motor, 
            and he conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and developed plans for an induction motor that would become his first step toward the successful utilization of alternating current. In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, 
            he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor.
             Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York with four cents in his pocket, a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first found employment with Thomas Edison, 
            but the two inventors were far apart in background and methods, and their separation was inevitable.</p>

        <p><b>Induction coil</b>, an <mark>electrical device</mark> for producing an intermittent source of high voltage. An induction coil consists of a central cylindrical core of soft iron on which are wound two insulated coils: an inner or primary coil, having relatively few turns of copper wire, and a surrounding secondary coil, 
            having a large number of turns of thinner copper wire. An interrupter is used for making and breaking the current in the primary coil automatically. 
            This current magnetizes the iron core and produces a large magnetic field throughout the induction coil.</p>

            <p>After Tesla’s death the custodian of alien property impounded his trunks, which held his papers, his diplomas and other honours, his letters, and his laboratory notes. These were eventually inherited by Tesla’s nephew, <ins>Sava Kosanovich</ins>, and later housed in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Hundreds filed into New York City’s 
                Cathedral of St. John the Divine for his funeral services, and a flood of messages acknowledged the loss of a great genius. Three Nobel Prize recipients addressed their tribute to “one of the outstanding intellects 
                of the world who paved the way for many of the technological developments of modern times.”</p>
